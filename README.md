## Projects

### Typing Simulator
I worked with a team on creating a Typing Simulator, which we further gamified. I enjoyed leading the team and pitching different ideas to implement (heat map, leaderboard, gloom-coin, shop-based). I practiced coding languages such as Node.js, CSS Animation, and Firebase.
